## This simple shell script is a replacement for the `./Build install'
## stage of the standard perl module installation sequence.  If you
## are installing as a private user, you do not have write access to
## the system level directories where perl wants to install modules.
## It is possible to override these locations from the command line,
## but that requires a large number of awkward command line
## arguments.  In this script, I have attempted to make good guesses
## for where things should be installed.  These guesses are:
##
##   modules:   install to the location in the PERL5LIB or PERLLIB
##              environment variable
##   scripts:   $HOME/bin -- a reasonable guess for where a normal user
##              might keep personal programs and scripts
##   man pages: into this directory -- this is roughly equivalent to
##              not installing the man pages.  most normal users do
##              not keep personal man pages
##   architecture dependent files:
##              the auto/ directory under PERL5LIB or PERLLIB
##
##  If this doesn't work for you, just edit this file as appropriate.
